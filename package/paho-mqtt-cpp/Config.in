	  This code builds libraries which enable applications to
	  connect to an MQTT broker to publish messages, and to
	  subscribe to topics and receive published messages.

	  This C++ client provides an interface which is intended
	  to mirror the Java API as closely as possible. It requires
	  the Paho MQTT C Asynchronous Client library.
