config BR2_PACKAGE_PAHO_MQTT_C
	bool "paho-mqtt3-c"
	help
	  This code builds libraries which enable applications to
	  connect to an MQTT broker to publish messages, and to
	  subscribe to topics and receive published messages.

	  The Paho MQTT C Client is a fully fledged MQTT client
	  written in ANSI standard C. Both synchronous and
	  asynchronous modes of operation are supported.

config BR2_PACKAGE_PAHO_MQTT_C_SYNCHRONOUS
	bool "Synchronous API"
	default y
	help
	  Synchronous for which the API calls start with MQTTClient.

	  The synchronous API is intended to be simpler and more
	  helpful. To this end, some of the calls will block until
	  the operation has completed, which makes programming easier.

config BR2_PACKAGE_PAHO_MQTT_C_ASYNCHRONOUS
	bool "Asynchronous API"
	default n
	help
	  Asynchronous for which the API calls start with MQTTAsync.

	  In asynchronous API, no calls ever block. All notifications
	  of API call results are made by callbacks. This makes the
	  API suitable for use in windowed environments like iOS for
	  instance, where the application is not the main thread of
	  control

config BR2_PACKAGE_PAHO_MQTT_C_OPENSSL
	bool "Secure API"
	default n
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_OPENSSL
	help
	  Establish an SSL/TLS connection using the OpenSSL library.
